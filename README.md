❄️ Snowy Analytics: Global Ski Resort Insights Dashboard
A dynamic and interactive Power BI dashboard designed to analyze, explore, and compare ski resorts worldwide — with a focus on terrain difficulty, lift infrastructure, resort features, and regional competitiveness.

📝 Short Description / Purpose
The Snowy Analytics Dashboard provides a visually rich, analytical environment to explore 499+ ski resorts across 38 countries and 5 continents.
It enables tourism analysts, travel planners, winter sports enthusiasts, and data strategists to compare global ski resorts based on features such as night skiing, summer skiing availability, slope difficulty, and lift types.

🛠️ Tech Stack
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
📊 Power BI Desktop – Main platform for creating visuals and analytical layers
📂 Power Query – Used for data cleaning, shaping, and transformation
🧠 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Custom measures, KPIs, and dynamic calculations
📝 Data Modeling – Relationships established between resort, snow, and reference tables
📁 File Format – .pbix for development and .png for dashboard preview images

🌍 Data Source
Primary Source: Ski-resort-stats.com & NASA Earth Observations
The dataset contains:
~500 ski resorts across the world
Details on country, continent, pricing, slopes, elevation, and lift systems
Additional snow-cover data for every month of 2022
A data dictionary describing variable definitions
The data is organized into tables such as:
resorts, snow, and data_dictionary.

⭐ Features / Highlights
📌 Business Problem
The global ski tourism industry generates billions in revenue, yet analysts, travelers, and tour operators often lack a simplified way to compare resorts across countries.
Key comparisons like best family-friendly resorts, regions with expert terrain, or availability of summer skiing are not easily accessible from raw data.

🎯 Goal of the Dashboard
This dashboard aims to:
Provide a global, interactive exploration tool for ski resorts
Assist in decision-making for travel planning and tourism strategies
Highlight patterns in slope difficulty, elevation, infrastructure, and ski seasons
Support regional competitiveness analysis
